As a civil engineer, what I do/will do allows everyone else to get to where they need to go.

I have a whiteboard that I write things down on, I am otherwise not very organized.

Interesting Fact: I only have one functioning kidney.

Understanding Concepts:
1. Git runs on my local machine and I can access it without internet access. GitHub is an online way to access other users and can be used to access your local files remotely.
2. Git and GitHub can be used independently but they are best used together because they were designed to be used simultaneously. There are many functions of Git/GitHub that are specific to the collaboration between Git and GitHub.
3. a repository is a location similar to a folder that can be used to store other files or documents. This can be created with the following commands:
mkdir NAME_OF_REPO
